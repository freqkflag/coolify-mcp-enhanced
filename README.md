# Coolify MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), enabling AI assistants to interact with your Coolify instances through natural language.

## Example Prompts

Here are example prompts you can use with MCP-compatible AI assistants to interact with your Coolify instance:

- Show me all Coolify servers in my instance
- What's the status of server {uuid}?
- Show me the resources running on server {uuid}
- What domains are configured for server {uuid}?
- Can you validate the connection to server {uuid}?

# Resource Monitoring
- How much CPU and memory is server {uuid} using?
- List all resources running on server {uuid}
- Show me the current status of all servers
```

### Project Management

```
# Project Operations
