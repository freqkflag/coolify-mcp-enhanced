# ADR 004: Environment Management

## Context

Environment management within projects - allows retrieving environment information and deploying applications within environments.

## API Endpoints Used

- GET `/projects/{uuid}/{environment_name_or_uuid}`

  - Get environment details by project UUID and environment name/UUID
  - Response: Environment object
  - Auth: Bearer token required

- POST `/applications/{uuid}/deploy`
  - Deploy an application using its UUID
  - Response: Deployment object
  - Auth: Bearer token required

Note: Environment creation and management is handled through the Projects API. Environments are created and configured as part of project setup.
